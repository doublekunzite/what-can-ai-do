            <h2>"AI will take all our jobs"</h2>
            
            <p><strong>The concern is understandable.</strong> AI does automate certain tasks, particularly repetitive cognitive work.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What we know:</strong> Historical tech disruptions (printing press, internet) transformed jobs rather than eliminated them. AI is likely to augment more jobs than it fully replaces.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What we don't know:</strong> The pace of change and whether new jobs will appear fast enough.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Focus on skills AI can't replicate—critical judgment, creativity, emotional intelligence, complex problem-solving. Use AI to handle drudgery while you build these human skills.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>"It's just autocomplete, not real intelligence"</h2>
            
            <p><strong>There's truth here.</strong> Current AI works by predicting likely next words based on patterns in training data—sophisticated autocomplete.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The counterpoint:</strong> Human cognition also involves pattern recognition and prediction. The line between "simulation" and "real" intelligence is philosophical, not just technical.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What matters:</strong> Whether it's useful, not whether it's conscious. Airplanes don't flap wings like birds, but they fly. AI doesn't think like humans, but it can help solve problems.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Judge AI by its outputs and limitations, not by philosophical definitions. Use it where pattern recognition helps; don't expect human-like reasoning.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>"AI is environmentally destructive"</h2>
            
            <p><strong>This is a real cost.</strong> Training large models requires massive compute power and water for cooling data centers.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Some context:</strong> AI represents a fraction of global computing emissions (less than 5%). Streaming video and cryptocurrency currently use far more energy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The trend:</strong> Newer models are more efficient. GPT-4 uses less energy per query than older models. Renewable energy adoption in data centers is growing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Use smaller models when sufficient. Batch your requests. Consider local models (like Llama 3) for frequent tasks to avoid data center load.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>"It's making us dumber"</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Valid concern.</strong> Over-reliance on calculators hurt mental math skills; GPS reduced spatial memory. AI could similarly atrophy certain cognitive abilities.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The research:</strong> Studies show students who overuse AI perform worse on critical thinking tasks. But those who use AI strategically—enhancing rather than replacing effort—perform better.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The parallel:</strong> Like power tools: they make you more capable if you understand the craft, but dangerous if you skip learning fundamentals.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Practice skills without AI regularly. Use it to check your work, not do your thinking. Always understand *why* the AI suggested something.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>"It's biased and discriminatory"</h2>
            
            <p><strong>This is true and serious.</strong> AI trained on historical data replicates historical biases—racism, sexism, ableism get encoded into the models.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Resume-screening AI favors male names. Medical diagnosis AI underperforms for women and people of color. Language models generate stereotypes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What's being done:</strong> Reinforcement learning from human feedback, bias detection tools, more diverse training data. Progress is slow but real.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Always review AI outputs for bias. Don't use AI for high-stakes decisions about people without human oversight. Advocate for transparency in AI systems you use.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>"It's a hype bubble"</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Some skepticism is warranted.</strong> History is full of over-promised tech (VR in the 90s, blockchain recently). AI shows bubble-like patterns: massive investment, unrealistic claims, speculative mania.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The difference:</strong> Unlike pure speculation, AI *works* for many tasks. Millions use it daily for real productivity gains. The question is sustainability, not functionality.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Realistic view:</strong> Current AI has significant limitations. The boom-and-bust cycle may continue, but the underlying technology will remain useful for specific applications.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your move:</strong> Ignore the hype. Focus on specific, practical uses that help you now. Don't bet your career on AI hype, but don't ignore real utility either.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>Your concerns are valid. AI is a tool, not a religion. Use it where it helps, question it where it harms, and maintain your own judgment above all.</p>
