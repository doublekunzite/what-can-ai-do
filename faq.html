                <p>AI is a foundational technology that has and will continue to eliminate barriers and revolutionize modern life. Classing it in a simple good/bad moral framework is similar to asking whether the Internet is bad, or whether automobiles are bad. Attempting to boycott foundational, ubiquitous technologies—or shaming people for using them—isn't sensible, but rather based on idealism and ignorance or neglect of material conditions.</p>
                
                <p>A better question would be, "How can we maximize the benefit of this technology to society while minimizing the risks and harms?" Countries like China are already viewing AI through this progressive lens and integrating it into their education systems.</p>

                <p>There are certainly risks of AI use compromising the development of certain skills. AI LLMs can also be obsequious, goading, and manipulative. The need for critical thinking skills and study of real world material conditions is only heightened by the existence of this technology. AI can confidently and convincingly make false claims which appear sound and well-cited. It's the perfect "debate bro". Becoming a savvy and cautious user of AI, capable of auditing and challenging AI output, will become an increasingly valuable skill in its own right.</p>

                    <p>"AI is making us stupid"</p>
                    <p>Valid concern. Over-reliance on calculators hurt mental math skills; GPS reduced spatial memory. AI could similarly atrophy certain cognitive abilities.</p>
                    <p>The research: Studies show students who overuse AI perform worse on critical thinking tasks. But those who use AI strategically—enhancing rather than replacing effort—perform better.</p>
                    <p>The parallel: Like power tools: they make you more capable if you understand the craft, but dangerous if you skip learning fundamentals.</p>
                    <p>Your move: Practice skills without AI regularly. Use it to check your work, not do your thinking. Always understand <em>why</em> the AI suggested something.</p>

                <p>The largest and most well known AI models created by private corporations currently require a significant amount of energy to train. So does running social media platforms—in fact, a social media interaction on Instagram or YouTube consumes significantly more energy than a ChatGPT AI prompt at the time of writing (November 2025).</p>

                    <p><strong>AI tasks are remarkably efficient:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ChatGPT text generation: ~0.3 watt-hours per prompt (source: Muckypaws)</li>
                        <li>Image generation (DALL-E): ~2.9 Wh per image</li>
                        <li>Audio generation: ~5 Wh per minute</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Social media consumes far more per interaction:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TikTok: ~10.4 Wh per 15-second video (source: Muckypaws)</li>
                        <li>YouTube HD: ~12 Wh per 5 minutes of streaming</li>
                        <li>Instagram/Facebook browsing: ~3.3-5.5 Wh per scroll/post (source: Muckypaws)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A key nuance: <strong>training large AI models is extremely energy-intensive</strong> (millions of kWh), but this is a one-time cost amortized over billions of uses. Inference (actual usage) is very efficient. As one analysis notes: "attributing the enormous cost of training across all subsequent uses is like blaming the energy required to build a power station on every lightbulb it powers."</p>
					<p><strong>For typical queries, Kimi K2 is demonstrably 85-90% more energy-efficient</strong> than major proprietary models due to its architectural design (<a href="https://fastgptplus.com/en/posts/kimi-k2-vs-gpt-5">FastGPTPlus</a>). DeepSeek's efficiency remains unverified, with credible sources suggesting it may actually consume more energy per complex task despite marketing claims of 40× savings . The ultimate efficiency advantage of open-source models comes not just from architecture, but from enabling smaller-scale, localized deployments that avoid the massive, always-on infrastructure of centralized platforms (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jlishawa_ai-energyefficiency-sustainability-activity-7392891215240806400-yql0/">LinkedIn</a>).</p>

				<p>Note: The above output is from responses to several different prompts. Kimi did not recommend itself unsolicited; I specifically asked how Kimi and Deepseek compare to the largest and most well-known AI LLM models on energy usage.</p>

                        <li>AI (Data Centers) Global annual water consumption for cooling will reach 4.2 billion and 6.6 billion cubic meters annually by 2027 (University of Illinois report 2024).</li>
                        <li>This is a major number, but important to note, this is a fraction of industrial agriculture use which uses 70 % of global freshwater with feed counting for a staggering 41% of all water used in Agriculture (Bryant Research 2025).</li>
                        <li>Per day production of beef, leather, and other cow byproducts equate to over 5 trillion liters of water. Dairy production alone uses 4.6 trillion liters of water. ChatGPT in comparison uses 18.2 billion liters of water (Bryant Research 2025).</li>
                        <li>Efforts to preserve global freshwater can't be hyperfocused on data center talking points, as agriculture remains exponentially a greater strain on water availability. Still optimal usage of water for cooling data centers is a necessity for long term usage.</li>
