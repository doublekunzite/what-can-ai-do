            <h2>Privacy & Data</h2>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Your inputs may be stored and used for training.</p>
            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> A company pasted proprietary code into ChatGPT; it later appeared in responses to other users.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Never share personal data, passwords, or confidential information. Use API versions with data retention disabled for sensitive work.</p>
            <p><strong>Severity:</strong> ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ (Very High)</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Accuracy & Hallucinations</h2>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> AI confidently states false information.</p>
            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> A lawyer used ChatGPT for case research; it invented fake legal cases with realistic citations.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Always verify facts independently. Use AI for brainstorming, not authoritative sources. Cross-check critical information.</p>
            <p><strong>Severity:</strong> ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ (Very High)</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Bias & Fairness</h2>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Training data contains human biases that AI replicates and amplifies.</p>
            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> Resume-screening AI discriminated against women for technical roles because training data favored male candidates.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Be aware of potential bias. Review AI outputs for fairness. Don't use AI for high-stakes decisions without human oversight.</p>
            <p><strong>Severity:</strong> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ (High)</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Dependency & Skill Loss</h2>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Over-reliance on AI reduces your own critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> Students using AI for homework show decreased performance on exams requiring original thought.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Use AI as a tool, not a crutch. Practice skills without AI regularly. Verify and understand AI suggestions.</p>
            <p><strong>Severity:</strong> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ (High)</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Training and running AI models consumes significant energy.</p>
            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> Training a single large model can emit as much CO₂ as five cars over their lifetimes.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Use smaller models when sufficient. Batch your requests. Consider local models for frequent tasks.</p>
            <p><strong>Severity:</strong> ⚠️⚠️ (Medium - Systemic Issue)</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Economic Disruption</h2>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> AI changes job markets and may displace certain roles.</p>
            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> Copywriters and entry-level programmers report decreased freelance work as companies adopt AI tools.</p>
            <p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Focus on skills AI can't replicate: critical judgment, creativity, emotional intelligence. Adapt tools to augment rather than replace your work.</p>
            <p><strong>Severity:</strong> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ (High - Long-term)</p>

            <h2>Risk Mitigation Checklist</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>✓ Never input sensitive personal or corporate data</li>
                <li>✓ Always verify factual claims independently</li>
                <li>✓ Review outputs for bias and fairness</li>
                <li>✓ Maintain your own skills; don't outsource thinking</li>
                <li>✓ Use appropriate model size for your task</li>
                <li>✓ Keep humans in the loop for important decisions</li>
