                        <p>Beyond searching and summarizing information from various sources far more quickly than a human would be able to, the <em>ways</em> AI is capable of summarizing are very powerful. AIs are now commonly loaded with a sophisticated understanding of how to teach and explain things to humans, and even unprompted they'll regularly offer metaphors and use other teaching tools that break down complex ideas to help you understand them intuitively.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Example 1:</h4>
                        <p>You're not familiar with how to use AI and want to explore the types of prompts that are possible. Ask the AI how you should prompt it for a particular question or task. "If I wanted to [achieve x task] with your help, how should I best prompt you?"</p>
                        
                        <p>I recently asked <em>Kimi</em> how to easily copy and paste entire conversations I had with it while maintaining clean formatting. It responded by giving me a prompt to send it for this exact task.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Example 2:</h4>
                        <p>Say you want to understand a difficult or counterintuitive science concept, like time as a fourth dimension. You ask the AI to explain it to you and the level of the explanation is too advanced. You can send it a follow up message asking it to explain the concept using plain language, or to explain it like you're a child—you could even specify the age of the child or the education level you're at. You could ask it to explain just one element of the concept at a time, or to use metaphors and explain it intuitively. If it uses a term you're unfamiliar with, ask it to break down to the term.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Example 3:</h4>
                        <p>You're studying for a biology test and you need to memorize the phases of mitosis and meiosis. Ask the AI to help you develop a mnemonic or a series of metaphors to help you with this memorization task. Then use it as a study partner and have it drill you—if you get stuck, ask for a hint.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Mitosis:</strong> One band splits into two identical bands that tour separately.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Meiosis I:</strong> The original band pairs up (two musicians per pair), swaps musical ideas (crossing over), then splits into two groups <em>by pair</em> (each group has one member from each original duo).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Meiosis II:</strong> Those two groups each split again, separating individual musicians—resulting in four solo artists, each with unique genetic "style."</li>

                                        <li>Remember <strong>I</strong> before <strong>II</strong>—Meiosis I is about separating <em>pairs</em>, Meiosis II is about separating <em>individuals</em>.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Crossing over = exchanging gifts</strong> only happens in Prophase I.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Mitosis = identical</strong> (makes two identical cells); <strong>Meiosis = half</strong> (makes four unique haploid cells).</li>
